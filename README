This program takes a user provided measurement and converts them to a desired measurement. 
To start, the user is asked what type of measurement they would like to do, indicated by typing
temp, mass, length, or volume. Once their choice is made, the user is asked which measurement conversion they 
would like and given number options corresponding to which conversion they would like. 
Once this is chosen, the user is prompted to enter the value of the measurement. The program then converts this 
input to the desired output. 
If any invalid input is given, the program alerts the user that the input is invalid, and the program quits. 
I have tested each case and confirmed each aspect of the program is working.

For future expansion, I would implement a system to make this continuous. It would give the user the option to 
convert another measurement after their first measurement without having to re-run the code. In addition, I would add
more conversion options in each measurement category.
